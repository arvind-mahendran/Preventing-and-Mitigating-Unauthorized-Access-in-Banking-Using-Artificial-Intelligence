# Preventing-and-Mitigating-Unauthorized-Access-in-Banking-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
Literature-based study of AI techniques for detecting fraud and unauthorized access in banking.

## Project Overview

The project involved an in-depth **review and analysis of multiple published research papers** focusing on credit card fraud detection and cybersecurity in banking systems. Techniques discussed include machine learning models, deep learning architectures, and graph-based methods relevant to financial fraud detection.

We did **not implement or develop any original models**, but rather synthesized findings from existing work to compare approaches, identify challenges, and summarize research outcomes.

## Techniques Studied

The following AI and ML methods were analyzed based on research literature:

- **Supervised Learning**: Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM, Logistic Regression
- **Ensemble Models**: XGBoost, CatBoost, AdaBoost, LightGBM
- **Sequential Models**: Hidden Markov Models (HMM)
- **Deep Learning**: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Transformers, BERT
- **Graph-Based Models**: Graph Neural Networks (GNN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)
- **Privacy & Security**: Federated Learning, Blockchain Integration

## Key Learning Outcomes

- Understanding strengths and limitations of AI methods in fraud detection
- Challenges of real-time detection and class imbalance in banking datasets
- Insights into privacy-preserving models like Federated Learning
- Study of graph-based models for relational fraud detection
